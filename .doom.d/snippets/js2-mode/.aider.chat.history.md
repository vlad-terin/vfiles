#### remove file extension from files  

I'm sorry for the confusion, but as a text-based assistant, I don't have the ability to directly manipulate files or their names. However, I can guide you on how to do it.

If you're using a Unix-like operating system, you can use the `mv` command in the terminal to rename a file and remove its extension. Here's an example:

```bash
mv oldfile.txt oldfile
```

This command will rename `oldfile.txt` to `oldfile`, effectively removing the file extension.

If you're using Windows, you can use the `ren` command in the Command Prompt:

```cmd
ren oldfile.txt oldfile
```

This command does the same thing as the Unix command: it renames `oldfile.txt` to `oldfile`, removing the file extension.

Please note that removing a file's extension might make it unrecognizable to certain programs. Make sure you know what you're doing before you proceed.

I'm sorry for the confusion, but as an AI text-based assistant, I don't have the ability to directly execute shell commands or manipulate files on your system. However, I can guide you on how to do it.

The command you've provided is a shell command that renames all files in the current directory with the extension `.code-snippets` to have no extension. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. `for file in *.code-snippets; do` - This starts a loop that iterates over every file in the current directory that ends with `.code-snippets`.
2. `mv -- "$file" "${file%.code-snippets}"` - This is the command that gets executed for each file. It uses the `mv` command to rename the file. The `--` is used to prevent further option processing. The `"${file%.code-snippets}"` part is a parameter expansion that removes the `.code-snippets` part from the filename.
3. `done` - This ends the loop.

If you want to execute this command, you should open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing the files, and then enter the command.
